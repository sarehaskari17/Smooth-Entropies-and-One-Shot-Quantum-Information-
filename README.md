# Smooth Entropies and One-Shot Quantum Information  
Self-Study Notes by Sareh Askari

These are my personal notes on **smooth entropies** (min- and max-entropy) and their role in
**one-shot quantum information theory**.

I hope these notes help anyone who is also exploring one-shot information theory or who wants an
intuitive introduction to smooth entropies.  
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss ideas or share suggestions!
